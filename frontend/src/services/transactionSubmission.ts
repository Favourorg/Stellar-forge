/**
 * Soroban transaction submission and inclusion tracking.
 *
 * `sendTransaction` has four documented statuses and only one of them
 * (`PENDING`) means "the network accepted this envelope and it is now waiting
 * for inclusion". Treating everything that is not `ERROR` as success made the
 * app poll hashes that could never appear (`TRY_AGAIN_LATER` — the envelope was
 * dropped before it ever reached the mempool), burn the full backoff schedule,
 * and then report a generic timeout. This module gives every status an explicit
 * path, and replaces the attempt-count timeout with a verdict derived from the
 * transaction's own timebounds/ledgerbounds:
 *
 *   PENDING          → poll for inclusion
 *   DUPLICATE        → poll the existing hash (already in the mempool)
 *   TRY_AGAIN_LATER  → resubmit the *same signed envelope* with backoff, then
 *                      report `dropped` — nothing was ever submitted
 *   ERROR            → parse the result XDR and surface the reason
 *
 * The distinction that matters for real funds: `dropped` and `expired` are
 * provably-not-included, so re-signing cannot double-execute `create_token` /
 * `mint_tokens`. `unconfirmed` means we lost visibility while the envelope was
 * live — retrying there could execute twice, so it is never advertised as safe.
