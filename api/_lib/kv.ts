/**
 * Vercel KV (Upstash REST) access, shared by every API module whose state has
 * to outlive a single serverless invocation.
 *
 * Vercel gives no routing affinity between requests: two calls belonging to
 * one logical flow can be served by different instances, so anything kept in a
 * module-level `Map` is visible to exactly one of them. `rateLimit.ts` was
 * already fixed for that (a per-instance limiter enforces a fraction of the
 * configured limit); issue #1091 is the same bug in the wallet-auth challenge
 * store, where a challenge issued by instance A could not be verified by
 * instance B. These helpers were extracted from `rateLimit.ts` so both callers
 * share one implementation rather than two drifting copies.
 *
 * ## Errors are thrown, never swallowed
 *
 * Every helper throws `KvError` on a transport failure or a non-2xx response.
 * A KV outage is not the same fact as "this key is absent", and only the
 * caller knows which way to fail — `rateLimit` denies the request, the
 * challenge store returns 500 rather than telling a legitimate client its
 * challenge expired. A missing key is still an ordinary `null` from `kvGet`.
