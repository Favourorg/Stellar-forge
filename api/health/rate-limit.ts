/**
 * `GET /api/health/rate-limit` — is rate limiting backed by a durable store?
 *
 * `isRateLimited` falls back to an in-memory per-instance limiter whenever
 * VERCEL_KV_REST_API_URL / VERCEL_KV_REST_API_TOKEN are unset. On Vercel,
 * requests have no routing affinity between invocations, so per-instance
 * counters enforce only a fraction of the configured limit — effectively no
 * working abuse protection (issue #14).
 *
 * This endpoint mirrors the pattern of `/api/health/auth` (challenge store
 * durability) and `/api/health/indexer` (indexer durability): it surfaces the
 * durable/degraded distinction so operators can catch a mis-provisioned
 * deployment before it ships without rate limiting on the upload endpoints.
 *
 * Presence only — no key material, no URLs, no counters.
