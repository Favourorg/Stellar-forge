## 1. Threat model

The factory contract's `admin` address is a single point of catastrophic trust. An attacker in possession of the admin key can:

| Action                                       | Effect                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `update_fees(admin, base_fee, metadata_fee)` | Set arbitrarily high fees to drain users who call the contract                                                      |
| `set_fee_split(admin, splits)`               | Redirect collected fees to an attacker-controlled address                                                           |
| `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`              | Replace the contract with arbitrary attacker code                                                                   |
| `propose_admin(admin, attacker_address)`     | Begin a rotation to an attacker-controlled address; the attacker then calls `accept_admin` to complete the transfer |
| `pause(admin)`                               | Halt the factory, denying service to all token creators                                                             |

**Two-step rotation reduces but does not eliminate admin-rotation risk.** The two-step model (`propose_admin` + `accept_admin`) prevents accidental rotation to an uncontrolled address — the incoming key must prove it can sign. However, an attacker who already holds the current admin key can still complete the rotation to their own address by controlling both steps. Detection window: a `propose_admin` call emits an `adm_prop` event that is visible on-chain _before_ `accept_admin` completes the transfer, giving operators a window to cancel via `cancel_admin_proposal` if the proposal is unauthorized.

**Upgrade detection gap:** `upgrade` currently emits no on-chain event (see issue #9). Until event emission is added, detection of a malicious WASM swap requires active polling of the on-chain WASM hash. This runbook treats upgrade detection latency as high-risk and calls it out explicitly.

---

## 2. How compromise would be detected

Detection relies on multiple independent signals. Any single signal is enough to begin the response procedure.

### 2.1 Sentry error correlation (fastest for client-side anomalies)

All Sentry events captured during transaction lifecycles are tagged with `network`, `contractId`, and `functionName` (see issue #944). An unusual spike in:

- `functionName: deployToken` errors with `InsufficientFee` codes (fee manipulation)
- `functionName: pollTransaction` failures across many unrelated users

should trigger investigation of the admin state.

Set a Sentry alert rule:

- Filter: `network = mainnet`, `functionName = deployToken`, `code = InsufficientFee`
- Condition: event count > 3 in 5 minutes
- Action: page on-call channel immediately

### 2.2 On-chain event monitoring (authoritative)

Subscribe to factory contract events via Horizon's Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint:

```bash
curl -N "https://horizon.stellar.org/accounts/<FACTORY_CONTRACT>/operations?cursor=now"
```

Alert on:

- Any `adm_prop` event (admin rotation proposed — act immediately if unexpected; you have until `accept_admin` is called or the proposal expires to cancel via `cancel_admin_proposal`)
- Any `adm_acc` event (admin rotation completed — if unexpected, the admin key is compromised)
- Any `fees` event with unusually large values
- Any `pause` event not preceded by a planned maintenance notice

### 2.3 WASM hash polling (required until issue #9 is resolved)

Until `upgrade` emits an event, poll the on-chain WASM hash at least once per hour via a monitoring script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-wasm-hash.sh — run this on a cron schedule (every 5 minutes on mainnet)
EXPECTED_HASH="<paste-the-deployed-wasm-hash-here>"
CURRENT_HASH=$(stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_state | jq -r '.wasm_hash // empty')

if [ "$CURRENT_HASH" != "$EXPECTED_HASH" ]; then
  echo "ALERT: WASM hash changed from $EXPECTED_HASH to $CURRENT_HASH" | \
    curl -X POST -d @- "$ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL"
fi
```

Store `EXPECTED_HASH` after each intentional upgrade and update the script immediately.

### 2.4 User reports

Token creators reporting sudden fee increases or failed `create_token` calls with no contract-level change on your end are a strong indicator of fee manipulation.

---

## 3. Authority and contacts

Maintain a live copy of this table in a private team channel. Do not embed real names or personal contact details in this public document.

| Role                      | Responsibility                                                               | Contact                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Incident commander**    | Declares the incident, coordinates all actions, is the single decision-maker | _See team contact list_ |
| **Admin key custodian**   | Has access to the hardware wallet / multisig device holding the admin key    | _See team contact list_ |
| **Break-glass custodian** | Has access to the backup admin (break-glass) account                         | _See team contact list_ |
| **Communications lead**   | Drafts and publishes user-facing notices                                     | _See team contact list_ |
| **Legal / compliance**    | Advises on disclosure obligations                                            | _See team contact list_ |

Minimum team size for executing on-chain recovery: **two people** (incident commander + admin key custodian). Never execute admin-level transactions alone.

---

## 4. Immediate response (first five minutes)

### Step 1 — Confirm the compromise

Do not act on a single noisy signal. Cross-check two or more of the detection signals in section 2 before proceeding.

```bash
# 1. Check current admin address
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_state | jq '.admin'

# 2. Check current fees
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_base_fee

# 3. Check current WASM hash against known-good value
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_state | jq '.wasm_hash'
```

### Step 2 — Call the incident commander

Even if you are the admin key custodian, do not act alone. Call the incident commander first. If unreachable within 2 minutes, escalate to the next person in the authority chain.

### Step 3 — Attempt to pause the factory (if admin key is still operable)

If the admin key has not yet been used by the attacker to transfer admin rights away:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- pause \
  --admin "$ADMIN_ADDRESS"
```

`pause` halts `create_token`, `create_tokens_batch`, `mint_tokens`, and `set_metadata`. It does **not** halt `burn`, so users can always recover their own balances. Fees already collected cannot be retrieved via this mechanism.

> ⚠️ **If the attacker has already called `propose_admin` followed by `accept_admin`** to transfer admin rights to their address, your `pause` call will fail with `Unauthorized`. Skip to step 4.
>
> ⚠️ **If you see an unexpected `adm_prop` event** but `accept_admin` has not yet been called, act immediately: call `cancel_admin_proposal` before the attacker can call `accept_admin`. You have up to ~28 hours (the proposal TTL) to cancel.

### Step 4 — Rotate admin to the break-glass address (two-step)

If the admin key is still operable but you suspect imminent key-theft (e.g. private key was exposed in logs), rotate to the pre-agreed break-glass account using the two-step flow:

**Step 4a — Propose the break-glass address as new admin:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- propose_admin \
  --current_admin "$ADMIN_ADDRESS" \
  --new_admin "$BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS"
```

**Step 4b — Accept from the break-glass account (must be done within ~28 hours):**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$BREAK_GLASS_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- accept_admin \
  --new_admin "$BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS"
```

Once `accept_admin` succeeds, the compromised key is locked out of all admin-gated operations. See [section 7](#7-break-glass-recovery-mechanism) for break-glass account details.

> 💡 **Why two steps?** The two-step model prevents accidental rotation to a typo'd address by requiring the incoming key to prove it can sign. In an emergency you need both the admin key (step 4a) and the break-glass key (step 4b) available — verify break-glass account access before any incident occurs (see the deployment checklist).

### Step 5 — Post to the incident channel

Immediately post the following to the team's incident Slack/Discord channel:

```
🚨 INCIDENT DECLARED — StellarForge mainnet factory
Time: <UTC timestamp>
Incident commander: <name>
Suspected action: <fee manipulation | admin transfer | WASM upgrade | unknown>
Admin key status: <operable | compromised — transferred away | unknown>
Factory paused: yes / no / failed
Next action: <describe>
```

---

## 5. Short-term stabilisation (first hour)

### 5.1 If the factory was paused successfully

- Monitor Sentry and Horizon for continued anomalous transactions.
- Assess whether funds were drained via `set_fee_split` before the pause.
- **Do not unpause** until the admin key custody situation is fully resolved and a new admin address has been established.

### 5.2 If the attacker has already transferred admin rights

- The contract is now under attacker control.
- **Do not attempt to call contract functions with the old admin key** — the transactions will fail and may leak information about your response timing.
- Begin the break-glass procedure in [section 7](#7-break-glass-recovery-mechanism).
- Note: if the attacker calls `upgrade` with a malicious WASM, the contract code itself is replaced. Verify the WASM hash before trusting any contract return values.

### 5.3 Fee impact assessment

Determine whether users were overcharged:

```bash
# Look for fee events with unusually high values
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_base_fee
```

Compare against the last known legitimate value from the deployment log. Document all affected transactions for later user communication.

### 5.4 WASM integrity check

```bash
# Get the current on-chain WASM hash
CURRENT_HASH=$(stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- get_state | jq -r '.wasm_hash')

# Compare against the known-good hash from the deployment log
echo "Deployed hash: $KNOWN_GOOD_HASH"
echo "On-chain hash: $CURRENT_HASH"
```

If the hashes differ and no authorised upgrade was performed, treat the contract as fully compromised. Do not use it until re-deployed with a new contract ID (see issue #32 for the forensic WASM-comparison process).

---

## 6. Recovery (first 24 hours)

### 6.1 Rotate the admin key

1. Generate a new admin keypair on an air-gapped machine or hardware wallet.
2. Once the break-glass account holds admin rights, call `transfer_admin` from the break-glass account to the new admin address.
3. Revoke the compromised key from all systems immediately.

### 6.2 Re-audit admin key custody

Before unpausing the factory, conduct an emergency review of how the admin key was compromised:

- Was it stored insecurely (clipboard, environment variable, unencrypted file)?
- Was the hardware wallet device physically accessed?
- Was phishing involved?

Document findings and apply remediation before resuming operations.

### 6.3 If WASM was replaced by attacker code

A `upgrade` to attacker-controlled WASM is the most severe scenario. The existing contract at the original address is now malicious and **must not be used**.

Recovery steps:

1. Deploy a **new** factory contract at a fresh contract address.
2. Re-initialize with the new admin address.
3. Notify all integrators and the frontend config must be updated.
4. Publish a security advisory explaining the impact.

### 6.4 Unpause

Only unpause after:

- [ ] Admin key custody is restored to a known-good state.
- [ ] WASM integrity is confirmed against the known-good hash.
- [ ] Fee configuration is verified to be correct.
- [ ] At least one additional team member has independently verified steps 1–3.

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$NEW_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- unpause \
  --admin "$NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS"
```

---

## 7. Break-glass recovery mechanism

This section documents the pre-agreed backup admin account that allows recovery from a scenario where the primary admin key is lost or the attacker has not yet taken over admin rights.

### 7.1 What the break-glass account is

The break-glass account is a **separate Stellar keypair** held by a designated break-glass custodian. It is never used for routine operations. Its sole purpose is to receive admin rights via `transfer_admin` in an emergency, then:

1. Pause the factory.
2. Transfer admin to a freshly-generated recovery key.
3. Facilitate any necessary fee or WASM restoration.

### 7.2 Custody requirements

| Requirement | Detail                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage     | Hardware wallet (Ledger or equivalent) held by the break-glass custodian        |
| Location    | Physically separate from the primary admin hardware wallet                      |
| Access      | Break-glass custodian only; known to the incident commander                     |
| Testing     | Confirmed usable (non-zero XLM balance, key unlocked) at least once per quarter |

### 7.3 Setting up the break-glass address

> Do this **before** mainnet deployment. Record the result in the deployment log.

```bash
# Generate the break-glass keypair on an air-gapped machine
stellar keys generate break-glass --offline

# Fund the break-glass account with at least 5 XLM for transaction fees
stellar keys address break-glass
# Transfer 5+ XLM to this address from the treasury

# Record the break-glass public address (never commit the private key)
BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS=$(stellar keys address break-glass)
echo "Break-glass address: $BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS"
```

Add `BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS` to the deployment log. The private key stays on the hardware wallet.

### 7.4 Activating the break-glass account

When a compromise is confirmed and the primary admin key is still operable, immediately transfer admin rights to the break-glass address:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$ADMIN_SECRET_KEY" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- transfer_admin \
  --admin "$ADMIN_ADDRESS" \
  --new_admin "$BREAK_GLASS_ADDRESS"
```

### 7.5 Multisig threshold (recommended for mainnet)

For higher assurance, configure the admin address as a multisig account requiring M-of-N signers before executing any administrative transaction. This means a single leaked key cannot take any unilateral action.

Setup outline (Stellar multisig):

```bash
# Set the admin account to require 2-of-3 signers
stellar transaction new \
  --source "$ADMIN_ADDRESS" \
  --network mainnet \
  -- set-options \
  --master-weight 1 \
  --low-threshold 2 \
  --med-threshold 2 \
  --high-threshold 2 \
  --signer "$SIGNER_B_PUBLIC_KEY:1" \
  --signer "$SIGNER_C_PUBLIC_KEY:1"
```

With multisig, `transfer_admin` and `upgrade` calls require assembling a transaction and collecting M signatures before submission. This introduces latency in an emergency but dramatically reduces the blast radius of any single key compromise.

---

## 8. Post-incident steps

Complete all of the following after the immediate threat is neutralised.

### 8.1 Forensic WASM comparison (see issue #32)

```bash
# Decompile and diff the on-chain WASM against the last known-good build
stellar contract fetch \
  --id "$FACTORY_CONTRACT_ID" \
  --network mainnet \
  --out-file recovered.wasm

# Compare
diff <(wasm-dis known-good.wasm) <(wasm-dis recovered.wasm)
```

Document any differences as potential attacker modifications.

### 8.2 Full deployment log audit

Review:

- When did the admin key leave the hardware wallet?
- Which machines accessed it?
- What processes had `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` in their environment?

### 8.3 Rotate all related secrets

- Treasury account keys (if the attacker potentially had access to the same environment).
- Pinata API keys (IPFS).
- Sentry DSN (if the compromise involved the deployment environment).
- Any CI/CD secrets that co-existed with the admin key.

### 8.4 User impact assessment

- Identify all `create_token` or `mint_tokens` calls that were charged inflated fees.
- Identify any tokens whose metadata was manipulated via `set_metadata` while attacker-controlled fees were in place.
- Determine whether any funds in the treasury account were drained via `set_fee_split`.

## 11. IPFS pin mass-unpin

> **Scope note:** unlike the rest of this runbook, this section is not about a compromised key. It is an operational failure mode with the same blast radius: permanent, irreversible loss of user data, caused by ordinary timing rather than an attacker.

### 11.1 The failure mode

`/api/cron/reconcile-pins` reclaims orphaned IPFS pins by unpinning every CID that the indexer does not list as referenced and that is older than the 24-hour grace window. That inference is only valid when the indexer's token set is complete. Three states leave it incomplete while every query still returns HTTP 200 (issue #1156):

| State                      | Trigger                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Store degraded to memory   | One failed Postgres connect on a cold start; the instance serves an empty in-memory store.                                        |
| Backfill unfinished        | Backfill processes 200 tokens per 5-minute run — a few thousand tokens take many hours, and reconciliation runs on its own clock. |
| Steady-state ingest behind | Recent `meta` events not yet applied.                                                                                             |

In any of them the reconciler would have concluded that live, on-chain-referenced metadata was unreferenced garbage and unpinned it. The pins cannot be restored: the upload session and the original file are long gone, and users see broken images and descriptions everywhere their `ipfs://` URI is resolved.

### 11.2 Safeguards now in place

1. **Readiness gate.** `checkReconciliationReadiness()` refuses the unpin phase unless the store is durable and connected, `backfillComplete === true`, and `lagSeconds <= 15 min`. A refusal is logged as `[pin-reconciliation] skipping unpin phase — <reason>` and returned in the cron response as `skipped: true` with `skipReason: "not_ready"`.
2. **No cached degrade.** `getStore()` retries the durable connection after 30s instead of caching an empty in-memory store for the instance's lifetime, and reports `durableConfigured && !usingDurableStore` through `getStoreHealth()`.
3. **Circuit breaker.** A run that would unpin more than 10% of the account (above an absolute floor of 5 pins) refuses and logs `[pin-reconciliation] circuit breaker tripped`, whatever the gate said.
4. **Dry run.** `?dryRun=1` (or `RECONCILE_PINS_DRY_RUN=true`) classifies and logs without calling Pinata.
5. **Health signal.** `/api/health/indexer` exposes `reconciliationReady`, `reconciliationBlocker` and `durableStoreConnected`.

### 11.3 Detection

```bash
# Is reconciliation allowed to delete anything right now, and if not, why?
curl -s https://<deployment>/api/health/indexer | jq '{
  reconciliationReady, reconciliationBlocker, durableStoreConnected,
  backfillComplete, lagSeconds, indexedCount
}'
```

Page on either of these:

- `durableStoreConnected = false` while `durable = true` — the instance is reading an empty store.
- Any `cleaned` value in a reconcile-pins run that is large relative to the account, or a log line containing `circuit breaker tripped`.

### 11.4 If a mass unpin has already happened

1. **Stop further runs immediately.** Remove `/api/cron/reconcile-pins` from the root `vercel.json` `crons` array and redeploy, or unset `CRON_SECRET` in the project so every invocation returns 401. Do not wait to finish diagnosing.
2. **Establish the blast radius.** Diff the affected CIDs against the on-chain `meta` events (the authoritative reference set) rather than against the indexer, which is the component under suspicion.
3. **Attempt recovery before the data ages out.** A CID that any other IPFS node still holds can be re-pinned by hash — `POST /pinning/pinByHash` with `hashToPin` — and public gateways may still have it cached. This window is short; try it first, in parallel with the rest of the response.
4. **Fix the underlying state** (restore the durable store, let backfill finish) and confirm `reconciliationReady = true` on the health endpoint.
5. **Re-enable with a dry run first.** Invoke `?dryRun=1` manually and read `wouldUnpin` in the response before restoring the schedule.
6. **Notify affected token creators** using the template in section 9.1, adapted: their metadata is unrecoverable unless re-uploaded, and re-uploading requires a new `set_metadata` transaction.

### 11.5 Deliberately exceeding the circuit breaker

Only after a dry run has been reviewed by a second person:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://<deployment>/api/cron/reconcile-pins?dryRun=1" | jq '.wouldUnpin'

# Reviewed and confirmed as genuine orphans:
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  "https://<deployment>/api/cron/reconcile-pins?override=1" | jq '{cleaned, errors}'
```
